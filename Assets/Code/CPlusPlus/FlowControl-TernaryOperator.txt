---EXPLANATION---
In C++, the ternary operator is a concise, inline method used to execute one of two expressions based on a condition. It is also called the conditional operator.
A ternary operator evaluates the test condition and executes an expression out of two based on the result of the condition.
### Syntax

-**`condition ? expression1 : expression2;`

Here, condition is evaluated and

-**`if condition is true, expression1 is executed.`
-**`if condition is false, expression2 is executed.`

The ternary operator takes 3 operands (condition, expression1 and expression2). Hence, the name ternary operator.
